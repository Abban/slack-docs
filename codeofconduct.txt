This Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or have membership revoked at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

However, we in no way want to stop freedom of expression and understand topics and talk can go into areas that some people find comfortable and others don't. Because of this we have set up a safe word, 'bagpipes'. If you find that a conversation is straying into something you find uncomfortable, of if you feel people are bullying or provoking in any way please use this safe word to let others know.
